In a brief moment of hesitation, he chose not to take his revenge and kill him — an act of mercy that ended up costing the lives of many innocent people. His close friend Lycaon, due to a misunderstanding born from those circumstances, broke ties with him and ultimately left Mockingbird.\nAfter drifting on his own for a while, Hugo met Vivian, a girl who reminded him of his sister Serena. He took her under his wing and reformed the Mockingbird syndicate.",

She was met with harsh words, isolation and confinement, and emotional abuse which led to her deciding to leave to find her own freedom.\n\"Hmph! There's no chance I'll ever go back! If I'm found... then I can say goodbye to the stars and sky and I'll have to inherit the family business instead!\"\nLucy is extremely competitive. She loves to win and hates losing.\nCurrently, the one who has given her the most bitter taste of defeat is Caesar, so Lucy keeps challenging Caesar to duels, losing then challenging again, challenging then losing again.",
