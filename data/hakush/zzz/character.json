The codename \"Seed\" was passed down from her guardian, the combat-grade Intelligent Construct formerly known by the same name, who now goes by \"Seed Sr.\"\n\nAccording to multiple sources, Seed is an unidentified orphan Seed Sr. rescued from Hollow Zero during the fall of the old capital. Seed Sr. adopted her and raised her alone in the Defense Force dormitories.\nA few years ago, Seed Sr. successfully applied to join Obol Squad, but not long after, he passed away due to irreversible damage to his logic core. As a result, Seed took his place in the squad. Any voice lines heard from Seed Sr. today are system-preloaded audio files.\n\nSeed possesses an extraordinary gift for mechanical engineering and research, capable of designing and building inventions far beyond the imagination of most. She also has an exceptional adaptability for Ether, able to push Seed Sr.'s combat capabilities to the limit by piloting him, through remote control, and by using custom combat modules.\n\nAnd so, despite her extraordinarily substandard physical capabilities and entirely mysterious origins, the military still gave tacit approval for her to serve as an elite soldier.\n\nSeed behaves quite differently from most people in everyday situations. She uses Seed Sr.'s cockpit as her bed, prefers confined spaces, and strongly dislikes talking to or interacting with anyone outside her immediate circle. Her logic jumps wildly, making meaningful conversation difficult.\n\nThe good news? For some reason, she's taken a special liking to you, Master, and the second assistant. You've been spared the long ordeal of earning her trust — and you don't have to worry about her occasional bouts of destructive behavior turning your way. Congratulations.\n\nSuggestion: Focus on topics like flowers and robots — her favorite things — when engaging in conversation. Stay calm when parts of her logic or meaning don't make sense; treating such moments as normal can help strengthen your bond with her.",

Word around Failume Heights is that Baorong lost his wife and two daughters when the old capital fell. In the years that followed, he took in five children. Yuzuha is the second oldest, with an older brother, a younger brother, and two younger sisters. The family lived on the second floor above the store, and with just two bedrooms, Yuzuha shared one with her sisters, while the boys stayed with Baorong. Now that her older brother has moved out and she mostly stays in the school dorm, the apartment feels a bit less crowded. But on weekends and holidays, Yuzuha usually returns from school to help her father at the store.\nEven as a child, Yuzuha showed a surprising level of maturity. Her eloquence and cheerful nature have made her a favorite among neighbors — and a hit with the kids around Waifei Peninsula and Sailume Bay.\nOn the Spook Shack forum, Yuzuha goes by the username \"Yuzupepper.\" In addition to her real-life friends Manato and Alice, she is also close with two other users known as \"Night Emissary\" and \"Strawberry Parfait\" on the forums.",

In that brutal struggle, the only one kind to Hugo — his sister, Serena — became the first to fall. The ones who orchestrated her death pinned the blame on Hugo, thinking it would destroy him. But to their shock, their father actually praised Hugo's actions, calling them the very traits a worthy heir should possess.\nAfter running away from his family, Hugo met Lycaon and Jack and learned to be a phantom thief. After Jack passed away, Hugo and Lycaon formed Mockingbird together.\n\nLater, during one of Mockingbird's missions, Hugo came face-to-face with his father. In a brief moment of hesitation, he chose not to take his revenge and kill him — an act of mercy that ended up costing the lives of many innocent people. His close friend Lycaon, due to a misunderstanding born from those circumstances, broke ties with him and ultimately left Mockingbird.\nAfter drifting on his own for a while, Hugo met Vivian, a girl who reminded him of his sister Serena. He took her under his wing and reformed the Mockingbird syndicate.",
